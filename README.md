  # This repo contains our final project for Tuwaiq Academy's Data Science and Machine learning bootcamp. 23/10/2022 - 5/12/2022
  
  We made a deep learning NLP model that can detect whether a text is depressing or not. And then deployed that model on a website where you can test it using simple sentences. We also have the option to enter a twitter username and our website will scrape his or her tweets run them through our model and then display a dashboard. The dashboard is interactive and contains multiple insights about his or her mental health.
  
# .venv

# DepressTrack_Site

 # Dashboard_Server
  This is the Dashboard will be displayed when the user inputs a twitter username and clicks analyze. It must be ran beforehand. You can change the TwitterUsername01 variable and that will change the account that will be analyzed.
