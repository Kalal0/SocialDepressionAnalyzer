  # This repo contains our final project for Tuwaiq Academy's Data Science and Machine learning bootcamp. 23/10/2022 - 5/12/2022
  
  We made a deep learning NLP model that can detect whether a text is depressing or not. And then deployed that model on a website where you can test it using simple sentences. We also have the option to enter a twitter username and our website will scrape his or her tweets run them through our model and then display a dashboard. The dashboard is interactive and contains multiple insights about his or her mental health.
  
# .venv
  Django enviroment filled with Python libraries
  
# DepressTrack_Site
  All things related to our website. Made with Django
    
# Presentation
  Self-explanatory has our presentation
    
 # Dashboard_Server
  This is the Dashboard will be displayed when the user inputs a twitter username and clicks analyze. It must be ran beforehand. You can change the TwitterUsername01 variable and that will change the account that will be analyzed.

### Twitter page
  As of 20/6/2023 Twitter has changed their policy regarding twitter scraping allowing only their tools to scrape. The method we used to no longer works. However I will describe how it used to work.

  After scraping the tweets, each tweet will be passed through our NLP model. Then the data will be displayed in the form of interesting graphs, that will be displayed on the website.
